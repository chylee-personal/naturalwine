    <p><strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/6/10/18650601/natural-wine-sulfites-organic" target="_blank" tooltip="Natural wine">Natural Wine</a></strong> is farmed organically (biodynamically, using permaculture or the like) and made (or rather transformed) without adding or removing anything in the cellar.</p>

    <p> No additives or processing aids are used, and 'intervention' in the naturally occurring fermentation process is kept to a minimum.
    Natural wine is more of a concept than a well-defined category with agreed-upon characteristics.
    In its purest form, it is wine made from unadulterated fermented grape juice and nothing else.</p>
    <p>“PEOPLE THINK THAT NATURAL WINE IS A FAD OR A NEW THING, BUT IT’S THE TRADITIONAL WAY TO MAKE WINE.
    IT’S CONVENTIONAL WINE THAT’S ACTUALLY NEW.”</p><p style="margin-top:30px;">
    <p>Many people — winemakers, distributors, writers, sommeliers — take issue with the term “natural wine.”
    Some prefer the phrase “low-intervention” wine, or “naked” wine, or “raw” wine. Scruggs calls her product “just fucking fermented juice.”
    But “natural wine” is the term that is most widely used, and anyone at a natural-inclined wine store, wine bar, or restaurant will know what you mean when you use it.</p><p style="margin-top:50px;">
